# thinkful-welovemovies-project

Back end capstone project for the Thinkful bootcamp. 
This project was set up by Thinkful for me to complete. 
My assigment was to make the adjustments in the src folder to add functionality outlined in the docs folder. 
I also changed the knexfile.js file to connect to a Postgres database.
